## Project Motivation



## Method and Results

The project followed the CRISP-DM method of data exploration's six steps of:
1. Business Understanding
2. Data Understanding
3. Data Preparation
4. Modeling
5. Evaluation, design and show the results
6. Deployment

The developed code  for the analysis can he found in the [notebook](https://github.com/gerald-e/).


## File Descriptions

* `Image Classifier Project.ipynb` contains the Python notebook containing all steps and further explanation for this analysis
* `example_100_07926.jpg` sunflower as an example
* `flower_data.tar.gz` data base with flower information
* `Readme.md` this file

## Used Libraries

The following libraries are required to run the notebook:

* matplotlib
* numpy
* pandas
* seaborn
* sklearn

## Installations and Dependencies

Each directory has a `requirements.txt` describing the minimal dependencies required to run the notebooks in that directory.
